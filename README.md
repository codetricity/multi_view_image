# Multi View
This project started since 2019, Shuhei Kozasa's master thesis.
Naoki Sato [posted in the RICOH THETA developer community](https://community.theta360.guide/t/using-usb-api-mtp-with-libghoto2-and-python-bindings-on-macos-raspberry-pi-linux-ros/4521/48?u=craig).  
This is entirely his code.

## Modifications

I've added version and package information to Naoki's README based
on his [post](https://community.theta360.guide/t/using-usb-api-mtp-with-libghoto2-and-python-bindings-on-macos-raspberry-pi-linux-ros/4521/50?u=craig).  Naoki originally developed this on Ubuntu 16.04.
